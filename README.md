Quickly toggle Low Power Mode from the menu bar

In macOS Monterey Apple introduced a new Low Power Mode for Mac. Cooldown is a simple menu bar app that allows you to quickly toggle Low Power Mode on and off.

⚠️ Root access

To toggle Low Power Mode, Cooldown uses Terminal commands that require root access. That is why the app will ask you to authenticate with TouchID on every toggle. I found a work around for this where the app will call a shortcut (that only needs to be approved once).
